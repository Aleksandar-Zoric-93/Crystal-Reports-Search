# Crystal Report Search

## Overview
This tool will allow users to search for a specific criteria against a selected report.  

### Features
* It will compare the search criteria against the entire SQL query contained in the selected report. 
* It will search for exact matches of table/command names against search criteria.
* Ability to view entire SQL query and command/table names by a click of a button
* Ability to preview the report from within the application itself.

This tool will prove to be useful when we have to check if a certain field or table is contained within a report.  Currently we have to manually open each report in Crystal Reports and inspect the SQL query.
